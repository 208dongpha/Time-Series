TEST RESULTS FOR DIFFERENT DIFFERENCING ORDERS
============================================================

Differencing Order d = 0 (Original):
  ADF Statistic: 3.1452
  p-value: 1.0000
  Critical Values:
    1%: -3.4656
    5%: -2.8770
    10%: -2.5750
  Stationary: No (p-value >= 0.05)
  Number of observations: 204

Differencing Order d = 1 (Differenced 1 time):
  ADF Statistic: -2.4952
  p-value: 0.1167
  Critical Values:
    1%: -3.4658
    5%: -2.8771
    10%: -2.5751
  Stationary: No (p-value >= 0.05)
  Number of observations: 203

Differencing Order d = 2 (Differenced 2 times):
  ADF Statistic: -10.2923
  p-value: 0.0000
  Critical Values:
    1%: -3.4658
    5%: -2.8771
    10%: -2.5751
  Stationary: Yes (p-value < 0.05)
  Number of observations: 202

============================================================
Suggested Differencing Order (d): 2

Interpretation:
  - H0 (null hypothesis): Series has a unit root (non-stationary)
  - H1 (alternative): Series is stationary
  - If p-value < 0.05: Reject H0, series is stationary
  - If p-value >= 0.05: Fail to reject H0, series is non-stationary
