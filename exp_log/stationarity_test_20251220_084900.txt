TEST RESULTS FOR DIFFERENT DIFFERENCING ORDERS
============================================================

Differencing Order d = 0 (Original):
  ADF Statistic: -4.4448
  p-value: 0.0002
  Critical Values:
    1%: -3.4322
    5%: -2.8623
    10%: -2.5672
  Stationary: Yes (p-value < 0.05)
  Number of observations: 3650

============================================================
Suggested Differencing Order (d): 0

Interpretation:
  - H0 (null hypothesis): Series has a unit root (non-stationary)
  - H1 (alternative): Series is stationary
  - If p-value < 0.05: Reject H0, series is stationary
  - If p-value >= 0.05: Fail to reject H0, series is non-stationary
